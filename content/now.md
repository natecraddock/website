## Projects

### zf

[zf](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf) is a terminal fuzzy finder written in
Zig. For a few years now I have tried to use fzf and fzy, but a few small
annoyances were enough of an excuse to write my own! The fuzzy finder is
minimalist compared to fzf, and has an algorithm that strongly prefers matches
on filenames.

Currently I am doing some small refactors in preparation to add unicode support.

### Open Reckless Drivin'

A reimplementation a Macintosh game from the early 2000s by Jonas Echterhoff. I
sometimes [write about interesting things I learn](/tags/reckless-drivin)
related to this project on my blog.

This project is on the backburner, but I'll get to it soon enough :)
