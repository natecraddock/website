## Projects

### zf

[zf](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf) is a terminal fuzzy finder written in
Zig. For a few years now I have tried to use fzf and fzy, but a few small
annoyances were enough of an excuse to write my own! The fuzzy finder is
minimalist compared to fzf, and has an algorithm that strongly prefers matches
on filenames.

Currently I am doing some small refactors in preparation to add unicode support.

### ziglua

[Ziglua](https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua) is a full wrapper around Lua 5.1
through 5.4 in Zig. It exposes the entire C API in idiomatic Zig. I'm still slowly
documenting the functions, but it is functional!

### Open Reckless Drivin'

A reimplementation a Macintosh game from the early 2000s by Jonas Echterhoff. I
sometimes [write about interesting things I learn](/tags/reckless-drivin)
related to this project on my blog.

This project is on the backburner, but I'll get to it soon enough :)

### Neovim Plugins

I maintain a couple of Neovim plugins. I don't actually use the editor anymore,
but I had the foresight to make the plugins simple enough that it really isn't
a maintenance burden to keep the repos up. I still get people starring them
regularly, so I guess the plugins are a sort of success?
