## Projects

### zf

[zf](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf) is a terminal fuzzy finder written in
Zig. For a few years now I have tried to use fzf and fzy, but a few small
annoyances were enough of an excuse to write my own! The fuzzy finder is
minimalist compared to fzf, and has an algorithm that strongly prefers matches
on filenames.

### Open Reckless Drivin'

A reimplementation a Macintosh game from the early 2000s by Jonas Echterhoff. I
sometimes [write about interesting things I learn](/tags/reckless-drivin)
related to this project on my blog.

I have been working on this off-and-on since the summer of 2020, but I think I'm
finally ready to pick things up again. Now that I have some experience with Zig
I think I will begin reimplementing everything I've done up to this point in Zig
as a way to get back into the project.

### Neovim plugins

I enjoy using neovim for most of my text editing. I am in the process of
polishing two plugins at the moment:
[workspaces.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/workspaces.nvim) and
[sessions.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/sessions.nvim). There is no
shortage of plugins for session and project management, but I found all of them
a bit too opinionated for my liking.

Both workspaces.nvim and sessions.nvim are more framework than plugin. They
provide nice APIs for interacting with a list of saved workspaces and session
files respectively. Used together, hooks can be registered to automatically load
and save sessions when opening a workspace.
