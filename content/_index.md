Hello, I'm Nathan!

I work as a software engineer maintaining internal software written in JavaScript and PHP. However, my real interests lie outside the world of web development.

Nearly all of my personal projects are written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org), but I also enjoy Lua, C, Python, and many other languages. I often find myself reinventing the wheel just to learn how something works, or to fix something that annoys me. Read my [now](/now) page for more details of what I'm currently working on.

I'm an active member of the open source software community; both creating new projects and contributing to existing projects.

* [zf](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf): a fuzzy finder that is optimized for filtering filepaths.
* [ziglua](https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua): an idiomatic Zig wrapper for the Lua C API.
* [open-reckless-drivin](https://github.com/natecraddock/open-reckless-drivin): a rewrite of an old Macintosh game.
* [workspaces.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/workspaces.nvim) and [sessions.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/sessions.nvim): simple workspace and session plugins for neovim.
* [projectile](https://github.com/natecraddock/projectile): a Blender addon to apply initial velocities to rigid body objects.
* [Blender](https://blender.org): I participated in the Google Summer of Code in [2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/) and [2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5735262606327808/) improving the outliner editor. My [commit
history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/natecraddock)
shows other areas I contributed to.

Outside of computery things I enjoy hiking, running, reading, playing piano, and making fancy pizzas.
