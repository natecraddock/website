Hi, I'm Nathan.

I'm a computer science undergraduate at BYU in my senior year. I work as a
teaching assistant for our Intro to Programming C++ course. As a teaching
assistant I developed [zygrader](https://github.com/cs142ta/zygrader), a system
for communication with the [zyBooks](https://zybooks.com) learning platform that
makes it easier for us to grade student submissions.

I am currently working on [zf](https://github.com/natecraddock/zf), a fuzzy
finder written in Zig, and [Open Reckless
Drivin'](https://github.com/natecraddock/open-reckless-drivin), a
reimplementation a Macintosh game from the early 2000s by Jonas Echterhoff. I
sometimes [write about interesting things I learn](/tags/reckless-drivin)
related to this project.

In the summers of
[2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/)
and
[2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5735262606327808/)
I participated in the Google Summer of Code with
[Blender](https://www.blender.org) improving the outliner editor. My [commit
history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/natecraddock)
shows other areas I contributed to.

Outside of computery things I enjoy hiking, running, reading, and playing piano.
