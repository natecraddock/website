Hi, I'm Nathan!

I am a computer science undergraduate at BYU in my senior year and I work as a
teaching assistant for two of our computer science courses. As a teaching
assistant I developed [zygrader](https://github.com/cs142ta/zygrader), a system
for communication with the [zyBooks](https://zybooks.com) learning platform that
makes it easier for us to grade student submissions. I really enjoy working in
Zig, C, Lua, and Python, but I also know C++, JavaScript, and Java.

In the summers of
[2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/)
and
[2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5735262606327808/)
I participated in the Google Summer of Code with
[Blender](https://www.blender.org) improving the outliner editor. My [commit
history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/natecraddock)
shows other areas I contributed to.

Read my [now](/now) page to see what I'm currently working on.

Outside of computery things I enjoy hiking, running, reading, and
playing piano.
