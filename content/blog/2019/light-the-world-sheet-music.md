I love Light the World! I love it so much that I just had to figure out how to play it on the piano!
So I transcribed the [2017 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_VRN7hcL_8) for the piano. From
there I also made sheet music for 2018's video. I'm also working on transcribing the original from 2016 right now.
While the song is very similar year to year, there is enough of a difference that I wanted to learn the song for each year.

Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up&mdash;that
which ye have seen me do. (3 Nephi 18:24.)
